# Clear Dummy Data from App

The app has dummy data stored in SharedPreferences from previous runs. To remove it:

## Option 1: Reinstall the App (Recommended)

**Android:**
1. Uninstall the app completely from your device
2. Reinstall the app
3. All old dummy data will be cleared

**iOS:**
1. Delete the app from your device
2. Reinstall the app
3. All old dummy data will be cleared

## Option 2: Clear App Data via Settings

**Android:**
1. Go to Settings > Apps > FortuMars HRM
2. Tap "Storage" or "Data"
3. Tap "Clear Data" or "Clear Storage"
4. Launch the app again

**iOS:**
1. Go to Settings > General > iPhone Storage
2. Find "FortuMars HRM"
3. Tap "Offload App" or "Delete App"
4. Reinstall from App Store

## Option 3: Add Clear Data Button (Developer)

If needed, I can add a developer option in the app to clear all data programmatically.

**Note:** After clearing data:
- The app will start fresh with no employees, attendance, or leave records
